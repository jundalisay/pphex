      quote : "*Compared to free international convertibility of currencies, Pool Clearing offers at least one outstanding advantage: **its inner mechanism tends to overcome temporary disequilibrium situations in international exchange by expansion instead of restriction**. The buyer is given the first move in the game.*"
