    #   # will use a double-entry system on the three tax classes where the interest of the buyers, renters, and employees checks the interest of the sellers, landlords, and employers, and the public interest of the government checks the combined interest of the two parties, who then check the government through elections. The simplicity of the system empowers everyone to check each other!
