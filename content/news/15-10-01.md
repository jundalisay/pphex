I decided to begin **NARA** or `Non-Arbitrary Resource Allocation` to implement my paper that predicts a coming crisis after the year 2018.

I've worked for web development companies, and I estimate that it will take 3 years to develop the NARA online economic system in time for that crisis.

The paper itself began in 2012. I started exploring different web frameworks in 2014. I've tried:

- PHP-Wordpress 
- Java-Spring MVC
- Scala-Play
- Groovy-Grails
- Ruby-Sinatra
- Python-Flask


So far, the winner seems to be **Python Flask**, especially since it can be easily deployed on **Google App Engine**. 

Ruby-on-Rails on Heroku and Groovy-on-Grails on Foundry are also good. But Google, as a company, will last longer than the others and so it would be wiser to go with its system.
