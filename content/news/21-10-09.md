We made it to the Top 10 of the Impacthub Agriculture Challenge but didn't make it to the Top 3.

Most of the challenges were agriculture related:

1. How can tech give real-time access to prices and supply of vegetables? 
2. How can small farmholders who have no tech, no money, and are illiterate better manage their farm operations to increase yields and profits? 
3. How can farm tourism thrive with real-time information on carrying capacity?
4. Digital access to local markets for farmers and fisherfolk through local ecosystems of delivery and storage services  
5. How can we fix the supply chain disrupted by the pandemic? 
<!-- food chain for low income communities  -->
6. How to give food security for low income comunities ? 
7. How do we decrease food waste and cut biodiversity losses?  
8. Tech solution to help smallholder farmers and fishermen access markets and bridge the disconnected value chain
 <!-- non-aggregator disconnected value chain bridge  -->
9. Non aggregator tech solution to ease transportation of food from island to island at better prices?


We prototyped our [Moneyless Banking System](/banking) that uses points. The event helped us polish Resource Banking into Points Banking and go into the details on how to implement it, in preparation for the future currency crisis happening in this decade.

<!-- #elevator:
Moneyless Banking is a decentralized rationing system that uses points that are pegged to food. It uses labor theory of value mentioned in The Wealth of Nations to remove the blockages in value-creation in order to increase the real wealth of society. It can be implemented by companies who want so save on cash, NGOs who want an alternative to UBI, and cash-strapped local governments who want an alterantive to money-welfare systems.

#problem
The invention of money in the 17th century led to economic growth by making exchange convenient. But it also allowed inequality, bubbles, crashes, and inflation. We invent moneyless banking as an alternative to money in order to provide economic safety against such problems.

#solution
Moneyless Banking uses points arbitrarily created by point-banks, just as commercial banks create money through fractional reserves. These points are pegged to grains and are not exchangeable with other point-banks or the market. Therefore, the points are not currency, but a store of value. This makes it resistant to inflation and financial crises. A precursor of this system is the moneyless economy of the Inca empire. We plan to implement it as a moneyless alternative to Universal Basic Income.

#target
We target companies and local governments which have severe money problems, or NGOs which are addressing severe socioeconomic issues in communities that are caused by the lack of money. 

#problem
The Bretton Woods agreement of 1944 US dollar as international currency instead of gold. This led to a discrepancy between the local USD and the Eurodollar. This was solved by the Nixon shock which created made the USD fiat. This led to stagflation as the USD in the US devalued to match the Eurodollar and petrodollar. This fiat USD then led to the stock market bubbles, 1997 Asian Crisis, 2008 Financial Crisis.

#solution
We bring back the Multilateral Clearing proposed by John Maynard Keynes and EF Schumacher as alternatives to Bretton Woods. Instead of a single USD international currency, each country has a clearing fund that uses local currency pegged to gold or grains. This makes currency speculation obsolete. Instead of forex trading, international investors invest in each country's clearing funds which go directly to exporters. 

#target
It is aimed for importers, exporters, customs, and commercial banks. We expect a future USD crisis to make this system worth looking into.
