Last week, we pitched our Pantrypreneur Farm system to Makati Rotary Club but couldn't get any significant reception for the idea. 

So we decided to pause it and focus on Pantrypreneur Educate which was relatively undeveloped.

By sheer coincidence, we met the lead administrator for AMSAI E-Learning on the same day. She was willing to implement our proposed moneyless tuition system.

We also partnered with AF Organic, an organic farm in Paranaque, to use exchange points for some of their transactions.
