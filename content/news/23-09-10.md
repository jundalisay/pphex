Our machine learning app/platform called ISAIAH got an Auth upgrade over the weekend. This means users can look at the compiled results of their answers upon logging in and getting authenticated. 


We delayed adding this feature as requiring logins also reduces the app being used if the login fails, such as when the internet is not available. 

We solve this by having some parts of the app capable of working offline, while other parts needing internet to work online.
