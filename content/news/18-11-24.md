DISH hackathon is a blockchain hackathon that seeks to fund use cases for ethereum, NEM, holochain, and other technologies. Among the implementations proposed during the event were user identification, blockchain voting, crypto micro-transactions, and tamper-proof transactions.

In 2017, we tried Ethereum to store the social contracts. This year, we tried NEM and found that it was equally impossible to maintain.
