We've submitted our fairtax entry to the Hackatax but was not shortlisted.

The [Hackatax](http://www.hackatax.ph) is a program by the taxation department of the Philippine government known as the [Bureau of Internal Revenue](https://www.bir.gov.ph) or BIR. It aims to find innovations to help make tax collection easier and more efficient. 

Our proposal is called Social fairtax which is a double-entry taxation system that we derived from our barter system.
