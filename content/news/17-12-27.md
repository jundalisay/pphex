We submitted "Gov" as our entry to the [World Govhack 2017](https://hackathon.govtechprize.ae/) 
The World Govhack is a hackathon by the UAE government to encourage new technologies to address issues in governance, refugees, citizenship, etc. 

This year, their focus is on developing blockchain solutions for public uses. 

We tried to add Ethereum to our system's social contracts but it proved to be very unwieldly and inefficient. So we scrapped blockchain from our tech stack.
