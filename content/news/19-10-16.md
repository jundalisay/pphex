Jose pitched the Oil of Hope (OOH) at QBO for the Accelerating Asia event as he tries to get support for his idea.

Oil of Hope is a new brand that makes coconut and cinnamon oils for massage, packaged by disabled people.

Jose didn't get support. However, he did get AWS credits which he shared with our developer team.
