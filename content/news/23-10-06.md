We started making apps for our proposed economic system in Q1 2015, in line with the startup concept of "Move Fast and Break Things". 

We then pitched the apps that we built in competitions to see which ones were important by the results or rank that we got.  We scrapped some and integrated others. The biggest milestone in development was our discovery of the Four Laws of Value which streamlined our experimentation process a lot. 

Here is a list of how the apps turned out.
