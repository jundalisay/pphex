We pitched Circle in the Pasig Climathon as a circular economy solution to food waste, food insecurity, persistent inflation, and unemployment.

[Wear Forward](https://www.wearforward.com/) won and will be awarded with a 30,000 peso budget to implement their project with the Pasig City Local Government.
