## Update

We didn't make it to the Top 10. Some of the top teams were:


1. Team Xcalp Webmint
2. FRM Coin 
3. Team Dvcode Sheesh! 
4. Team Life


We learned that the play to earn model does not work for the app maker because there must be another source of revenue like ads, subscription, esports.
