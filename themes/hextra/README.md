True Economic Democracy. Pantrypoints implements trisactions in order to create an Economy-as-a-Service or EaaS platform to create "True Economic Democracy".
Register in the Waitlist. Read about the details. 
This is based on the requirements in Book 5, Chapter 2 of Plato's Republic.
'The Points Economy'. Instead of money, Pantrypoints uses points which are pegged to the retail price of grains. This will allow easier points-taxation, points-accounting and analytics, while eliminating the need for money for transactions.
Loyalty Points. These are points given by businesses to their customers to incentivize repeat purchases. This is used to ’train’ people in the use of points.
Donation Points. These are points used for donations and disaster relief. We use this primarily to incentivize 'food rescue' and plastic waste collection in order to realize a moneyless circular economy.
Exchange Points. These are points for barter transactions. Unlike donations points which do not seek something in return, trade points do. This is the foundation of Points-banking.
Investment Points. These are exchange points designed to attract investments when money is lacking. This requires the other point-types to be working beforehand.
Insurance Points. These are exchange points for long-term claim, upon old age. We implement this as social insurance in case money-based insurance becomes oppressive.
Energy Points. These are exchange points for electricity, usually from biomass sources. This incentivizes waste segregation and is part of the circular economy.
Money Points. These are exchange points paid in money to reduce existing trade-points balances.
Cross Points. These are exchange points used for cross-border transactions. These are 'weighted' to prevent imbalances in trade. 
Tax Points. These are exchange points given by users to the government.
Current Implementations. The Pantrypoints system is currently being tested by the following
SCENAC is testing Point Cards as a moneyless social insurance system
Angel’s Shelter is an animal shelter that uses Pantrypoints Build to get moneyless donations
Savilas Vietnam is a new seafood buyer that will test exports via Pantrypoints World
Food Rescue Philippines is a volunteer group that will test Pantrypoints Circle for incentivizing food donations
